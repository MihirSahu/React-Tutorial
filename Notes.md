# React Notes

- I'm skipping the basics of the terminal and npm because I'm familiar with those already.
- Easy way to create a react app is the "Create React App" package from the official facebook git repo
  - Install with `npm install -g create-react-app`
  - Create a new app with `npx create-react-app my-app`
- Babel is a js compiler that converts new js to old, stable js that's used by most browsers
- Great extensions: Prettier and ES7 React/Redux/GraphQL/React-Native snippets

## Questions

What's the difference between import and require()?

- Ex. "import React from 'react'" vs "const http = require('http')"
